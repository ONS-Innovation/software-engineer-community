Standards
===========================

## As a software engineering community we believe:

* We should be open to change
* We should keep feedback constructive, but also not view feedback as an attack
* We should use up to date tools wherever possible
  * Managed artefact mirroring services and firewalls should not be a barrier to this
* We should have access to a wider array of tools than the bare minimum for our project
  * We should have access to all tools used across the ONS estate
  * We should have access to install and trial new tools in order to innovate
* 20% of our time should be devoted to self-development and professional improvement

## We also strive to follow the following additional principles
* [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/)
