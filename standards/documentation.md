Documentation Standards
===========================

Git repositories should contain a README.md at the top level which should explain what the service is for and how to get it working. This should include listing dependencies and required configuration (though not including actual credentials).

Confluence is being used to capture discussions, decisions and processes. This includes documenting legacy systems and systems which are not using Git for source control.

Documentation should not contain active usernames or passwords, or infrastructure details such as IP addresses, model numbers or server names.  To satisfy this some diagrams may need to be edited before being shared on wider platforms.

### These standards have not yet been defined.

Areas for discussion include:
* licenses - what licenses to use when, how to find the correct license, where they should be in a repo
* clarity around whether linking to restricted files is ok
* clarity around code snippets - is some level of snippet ok, they jsut shouldn't contain credentials?
